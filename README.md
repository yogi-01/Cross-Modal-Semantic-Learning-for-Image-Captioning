# Cross-Modal-Semantic-Learning-for-Image-Captioning
This project explores cross-modal representation learning for image captioning, where a deep learning model learns to generate textual descriptions from images. The model bridges the gap between visual and textual modalities by extracting meaningful representations from images and mapping them to natural language descriptions.
